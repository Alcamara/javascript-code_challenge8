### Problem:
You are tasked with writing a program that simulates a simple vending machine. The vending machine offers the following products:

1. Soda - $1.25
2. Chips - $1.50
3. Candy - $0.75

- Write a function called vendingMachine that:
  - Takes an array of product numbers as input.
  - Uses a loop to process each product in the array.
  - Uses a switch statement to determine the price of each product.
  - Keeps track of the total amount the user needs to pay.
  - Prints each product name and price as it's processed.
  - After processing all products, prints the total price.

If an invalid product number is encountered (i.e., not 1, 2, or 3), it should print a message saying "Invalid product."
